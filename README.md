# **Online Recipe Application**

## **Project Overview**
This is an **Online Recipe Application** built with **React**, **CSS**, and an **API** to manage and display recipes. Users can browse, search, and explore a wide variety of recipes, each with detailed instructions and ingredients. The application fetches recipe data from an external API and provides a seamless user experience with a dynamic interface.

In addition to the React frontend, the project includes a backend server that handles API calls and other necessary functions. You need to run the server to fully utilize the application.

## **Features**
- **Recipe Search**: Users can search for their favorite recipes using the API.
- **Recipe Details**: Each recipe includes ingredients, instructions, and cooking times.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, making it accessible on various devices.
- **Asynchronous API Handling**: The app fetches recipes from an API in real time.
  
## **Prerequisites**
- **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your machine.
- An active internet connection to fetch recipe data from the API.

## **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/online-recipe-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd online-recipe-app
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## **Running the Application**
1. **Run the server**:
   Start the backend server to handle API requests and other services.
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

2. **Run the React app**:
   Start the development server to launch the React frontend.
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to start browsing recipes.

## **Technology Stack**
- **React** for building the frontend.
- **CSS** for styling and responsiveness.
- **API** for managing and fetching recipes.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
